# Basic Rules for the Challenges 


* First, thank you for participating in the challenges!  

* We have tried hard to make sure you will not spend more than a few
hours to complete your answer.  **Please do not spend more than a few hours!**

* We still allow for **48 hours** so that
you can find a few hours in your schedule. **Please return your work to us within 48 hours**.

* **Pick one of the challenges in one of the directories here**. You can do more than one if you wish but we only require that you pick one and submit answers for one. 

* Your answer will be completely original and not based on someone else's work. We are aware some challenges are available with
solutions from various websites.  If your solution is based on any previous solutions, please clearly indicate the source.

* You can use any one of the following scripting or programming languages:  **Bash, SQL, YAML, Python, Node.js, Java, Kotlin, Go, Rust**.  If you must use another programming language please ask us first. Most questions listed here can be solved by using a small script, via shell prompt or shell script, or not using any programming languages at all. For example, you can just use YAML and SQL for some questions.

* Please submit your answer via  **a public github repository** you have created. **You should submit URL to your public github repo when you return your answers to us.**
Your repository should contain: code, scripts, documentation, tests, design notes, etc. 

* Your git repository should contain a script called `run.sh` or `run.bat` that will run the
code and produce the results.  That is to say, **the reviewer of your work should just be able to run one script** to see that it compiles if necessary 
and runs the program and produces the output with all of the necessary arguments and inputs required. If your script does not produce correct results the evaluation
will be negative.

* Your git repository should also contain a `README.md` file which provides information about the input needed, output produced, the code, algorithm, design, and other related facts about your solutions.  **Please check that your answers are complete and address all the necessary parts of the challenges**.

* The challenges here are described in the final and complete form. **The challenges may be updated from time to time. It is up to you to check your answers before submitting your answers for completeness**.

* Whatever may be considered missing in the description of each challenge can be assumed to be intentional.  **No further clarification will be provided**.

* You are encouraged to provide any corrections, feedback, criticism, or suggestions for improvements in writing.

* **Your ability to follow the instructions carefully as written here is part of the evaluation**.
