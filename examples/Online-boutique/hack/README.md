## `hack/` 

This directory contains the scripts for creating a new `microservices-demo` release.

### Create a New Release

#### 1. Decide on the next release version number using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
- Look at the [commits since the previous release](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/commits/main).

#### 2. Open a new terminal.

#### 3. Make sure you have `gsed` installed. If not, `brew install gnu-sed`.

#### 4. Set the following environment variables:

- `TAG` - This is the new version (e.g., `v0.3.5`).
- `REPO_PREFIX` - This is the Docker repository. 
##### Example: 
```
export TAG=v0.3.5
export REPO_PREFIX=gcr.io/google-samples/microservices-demo
```

#### 5. Run `./hack/make-release.sh`.

- Make sure you run `./hack/make-release.sh` from this project's root folder â€” **not** from inside the `hack/` folder. 
- This script:
  1. uses `make-docker-images.sh` to build and push a Docker image for each microservice to the previously specified repository.
  1. uses `make-release-artifacts.sh` to regenerates (and update the image $TAGS) YAML file at `./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml`. 
  1. runs `git tag` and pushes a new branch (e.g., `release/v0.3.5`) with the changes to `release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml`.

#### 6. Make sure the new Docker images were created and pushed.

- Go through [our Container Registry repository](https://pantheon.corp.google.com/gcr/images/google-samples/global/microservices-demo?project=google-samples).
- Make sure a Docker image was created for each microservice (with the new version tag).


#### 8. [Draft a new release on GitHub](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/releases).

- Summarize the [commits since the previous release](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/commits/main).
- See previous releases for inspiration on release notes.

#### 7. Create a new pull-request.

- When you ran `make-release.sh`, it created a new branch (e.g., `release/v0.3.5`).
- Include the new release draft in the pull-request description for reviewers to see.

#### 8. Once your pull-request is approved, merge it.

#### 9. Connect to our [online-boutique-release GKE cluster](https://pantheon.corp.google.com/kubernetes/clusters/details/us-central1-c/online-boutique-release/details?project=online-boutique-ci)

- To do this, you can use:
```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials online-boutique-release \
  --zone us-central1-c --project online-boutique-ci
```

#### 10. Deploy `release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml` to our [online-boutique-release GKE cluster](https://pantheon.corp.google.com/kubernetes/clusters/details/us-central1-c/online-boutique-release/details?project=online-boutique-ci).


```
kubectl apply -f ./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml
```

#### 11. Make sure [onlineboutique.dev](https://onlineboutique.dev) works.

#### 12. [Publish your draft release on GitHub](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/releases)!
