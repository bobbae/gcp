 * Write a class in C++ which manages an pointer to memory block aligned at 16 bytes boundary. 
 * The class should support unsigned, float and double data types for the memory pointer. 
 * It should accept the size of memory block and produce a pointer to memory block of that size
 * with address aligned to 16bytes. The class should support copy and copy by assignment
 * construction of its objects. There should be an deference operator '*' which should return the
 * raw pointer maintained by the class. Please also provide a small main function to illustrate
 * the usage of this class. */
