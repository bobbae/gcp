# Question:  tennis-rain


## Steps

* Consider the following description:

   Suppose, from 4 tennis matches, 
   Bob won 3 and Alice won only one.


* Question 1:  If you have to bet on either Bob or Alice for the next match who would you bet on?

* Question 2: What is the percentage of the chance that Alice might win the next match?

* Now, consider further:

   To make it more interesting, let us add another factor to the match,
   which is rain. 
   When Alice won, it was raining. 
   But, when Bob won, out of 3 matches, 1 
   time it was raining.

   By the way, the weather forecast says 
   that there is an extremely high possibility 
   of rain on the day of the next match 
   which is tomorrow. 
   And the forecast is typically 
   very accurate.


* Question 3: Do you agree that even without thinking deeply, 
you can tell that the comparison basis has 
changed and chances of Alice winning have increased?

* Question 4: Who would you bet on as the winner of the next match?

* Question 5: What is the percentage of the chance that Alice will win the next 
match given that it will rain tomorrow?
