Provide sample code for three independent tasks. This directory
contains a source file for each of the three tasks with instructions appearing as header
comments in the respective files. You may also see some skeleton code which you need to
complete based on the instructions given in the source file.

## Deliverables

- Sample code for Task 1, 2 and 3 
- A Makefile which compiles complete programs for Task 1 and Task 2 with GNU C/C++ compiler
- For Task 3 the above Makefile should just generate an object file, complete program is not needed.
- Programs corresponding to Task 1 and Task 2 should be runable on a GNU/Linux PC such as a computer running Ubuntu.
