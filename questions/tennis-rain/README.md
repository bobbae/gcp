# Question:  tennis-rain


## Steps

* Consider the following description:

   Suppose, from 4 tennis matches, 
   Bob won 3 and Bill won only one.


* Question 1:  If you have to bet on either Bob or Bill for the next match who would you bet on?

* Question 2: What is the percentage of the chance that Bill might win the next match?

* Now, consider further:

   To make it more interesting, let us add another factor to the match,
   which is rain. 
   When Bill won, it was raining. 
   But, when Bob won, out of 3 matches, 1 
   time it was raining.

   By the way, the weather forecast says 
   that there is an extremely high possibility 
   of rain on the day of the next match 
   which is tomorrow. 
   And the forecast is typically 
   very accurate.


* Question 3: Do you agree that even without thinking deeply, 
you can tell that the comparison basis has 
changed and chances of Bill winning have increased?

* Question 4: Who would you bet on as the winner of the next match?

* Question 5: What is the percentage of the chance that Bill will win the next 
match given that it will rain tomorrow?
